		<h2> Javascript! </h2>
			<p>Javascript! It's so hot right now! Javascript. (Zoolander reference!)</p>

			<p>Javascript is indeed everywhere. What is the reason for the ubiquity, you ask? Well I hope to address this question in this blog post.</p>

			<h3> Why Javascript is popular in web development: </h3>
			<p>You've probably accessed web applications in your internet browsing right? Of course you have. We run applications on the web, via the web browser all the time! Some common web applications are things like Google Maps, facebook, etc. These sites are not merely websites, but are web applications, and surprise! They are written in JavaScript!
			</p>
			<p> What does the JavaScript do, you ask? Well, generally it is included in the coding of a web application, and it enhances the dynamics and interactive features of the web page, by allowing the web site to do things like add special effects, customize graphics, create security passwords, etc! You're probably thinking to yourself, "Hey yeah, I've seen websites that do that kind of thing!" Javascript is what makes websites INTERESTING, adding interactive effects within web browsers, without it the web would be boring. :)
			</p>

			<p>Basically, JavaScript is the reason why people who use the web are able to input info and interact with most of the websites they visit on a daily basis!</p>


			<h3> What are the great things about JavaScript? </h3>
			<p>JavaScript used to have a bad rep! Skilldrick describes JavaScript's bad reputation thusly, in his blog: "...JavaScript was this stupid language which had stupid syntax and stupid scope and was used to do stupid things by stupid people and just led to awful spaghetti code and killed kittens." YEESH. But it's come a long way! </p>

			<p>One of the reasons for it's popularity, aside from the fact that it makes web applications LOOK COOL, is that you don't have to be a programming wizard to use JavaScript. There are a lot of programmers out there who have already gone through the trouble of writing the code that makes pages look cool and have functions that you may want to incorporate into your own web pages. These scripts are often freely avialable for you to copy from script libraries, and you can use them on your own site! You just follow instructions provided with the script to customize to your liking, then paste into your web page!
			</p>

			<p>Currently, a lot of development energy is being put into new technologies, like the ones coming out of HTML5. Since JavaScript is the programming language behind HTML5, it behooves programmers to know JavaScript, or they may get left in the dust when it comes to developing these new and exciting technologies!</p>

			<p>Another reasons why JavaScript is awesome: it comes installed on every modern web browser, so you can program in JavaScript right away, without having to deal with complicated downloads and installation of additional software. </p>

			<h3> What are JavaScript's limitations: </h3>

			<p> A lot of JavaScript's limitations are pretty technical in nature, so may not be interesting or make sense to the layperson. However, there are some that I have come across that may be of concern to the average person.
			</p>
			<p>JavaScript does nto have multithreading capabilities. Multithreading is the ability of a program or OS process to manage use by more than one user at a time, or to manage multiple requests by one user. </p>
			<p>JavaScript can't access web pages hosted on a different domain solely using JavaScript. </p>
			<p>JavaScript depeds a lot on the browser it runs on. Different browsers (firefox, IE, safari, etc) interpret JavScript differently. So if you're writing JavaScript code, it's best to always test it on all major browsers before you put your code out into the world!</p>
			<p>And apparently, you cannot use most of your local devices with JavaScript. You cannot access your printer or other user devices directly via JavaScript. </p>
