		<h2> Pairing and Giving Feedback </h2>

		<h3>Pairing</h3>
			<p>I think that pairing with others to solve challenges has been an extremely rewarding, beneficial, and productive experience for me. One particular example of a rewarding pairing was my first pairing session this week. I had been having a hard time conceptually understanding ruby classes and instance variables, etc. The materials I was finding online were helping, but the information just wasn't solidifying in my mind. In one short pairing session, my partner was able to provide concrete examples in the stypi code, and bam! It made sense to me. This was totally awesome, and I am truly grateful to my pairing partner for helping to clarify the topic so much.</p>

			<p> Pairing has also been outside of my comfort zone, challenging, intimidating, and sometimes an emotionally trying experience at times. This week especially has been rough, because I got a late start to the challenges, due to my full-time work schedule and happenings in my life (parents were visiting from out of town over the weekend/early part of this week, etc). As a result, all 3 of my pairing sessions this week took place while I felt behind, frustrated at myself, and like my knowledge was sub-par. I still tried my best, brought all of myself to each session, and tried to add something to the pairing, as far as knowledge. But these feelings definitely affected me during my pairings. </p>

			<p>I think part of my problem is that I still doubt myself a lot, especially when pairing. When I am working on a challenge by myself, I am able to take as much time as I need to read over the instructions, think things over, and ruminate. If there is a block of code that confuses me, I can take however much time I need to really break it down until I understand it. This is how I naturally operate, inside my own head. It is definitely a much larger challenge having to think out loud and to try to express my ideas verbally. I feel like I can't necessarily take the time I need to mentally process code, when I am working in a pairing. I feel that I am slowing the pairing down by doing so, and I can't even focus on the code when I am thinking, cause I'm thinking to myself, "ok, don't take too long." I worry constantly that I'm not good enough, that I'm letting my pairing partner down, and that I'm the shitty partner that no one wants to pair with. </p>

			<p>I think I need to work on being less hard on myself. My lack of confidence surely shows in the way I carry myself in my sessions, and I *do* know more than I am willing to see in myself. Nothing beats the feeling of when my code works and passes all tests, and outputs what it's supposed to. I need to remember THAT feeling, and let myself think, "hey, yeah, I can totally do this." It's something I will have to continue to work on, this type of attitude adjustment.</p>

		<h3>Feedback</h3>
			<p>While reading my feedback, I felt many types of simultaneous and sometimes conflicting emotions. I felt extremely happy reading that my communication skills were good, that I was fun to work with, that people want to work with me again, and that my energy was good. It helps to build a bit of confidence that I'm not a terrible partner to work with! I also felt some shame and disappointment in myself. I think my lack of confidence during pairing has translated into not presenting myself in a way that appears to be technically as competent as I could be. While I definitely think this is a valid criticism, it hurts and makes me mad at myself. At the same time, it reaffirms my earlier statement that I need to work on my confidence. </p>

			<p>An enlightening piece of feedback that I just read was that "Sometimes, however, [I'd] get frustrated about little things which was slightly distracting." This definitely hits home for me, cause it's something about myself that I really dislike. I *do* get frustrated easily at times, particularly when I can't understand something. I'm the type of person who really wants to understand everything that is put in front of me. Clarity and comprehension of the materials are what I desire, at all times. I'm the kind of person who turns up the volume all the way during phone calls, so that I don't miss any words that may be key to context, and to help determine the emotional state of the other person, etc. It really drives me crazy when I feel like I'm not "getting" everything that I'm supposed to get. As I said, I do not like this about myself. While it makes me fastidious and driven (arguably good things), it also makes me a perfectionist and lacking in patience (as this feedback seems to indicate). It is something I have been working on, and must continue to work on improving. Relax. Take a deep breath. It's OK if I don't get it yet, just keep calm and carry on and the comprehension will (hopefully) come. </p>

			<p>Writing feedback has been easier for me, than receiving it. I found the video presentation on specific, kind, actionable feedback to be very helpful, and I try to follow the spirit of those 3 things in all my feedback. I think the hardest part is remembering to write the feedback ASAP after a pairing, so that the session is still fresh in my mind!</p>

			<p>Overall, I think that pairing and feedback are integral when it comes to fostering and developing the growth mindset. I have already become more mindful in my pairing, and am learning a great deal. Both of these activities are outside of my comfort zone, but I think that engaging in them is an extremely beneficial experience for me. It is great to feel challenged, motivated, and inspired by my DBC cohort mates! </p>
