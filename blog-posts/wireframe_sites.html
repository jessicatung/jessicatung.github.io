		<h1> Jessica's Wireframe Sites</h1>
		<p> Please pardon the lack of pizazz, was running out of time!</p>

		<h2> The Oatmeal</h2>
			<p> The oatmeal has a simple and clean layout. Since the objective of his website is to provide his readers with easy access to his comics/posts, he has laid them out in a logical fashion to meet those goals. Posts are organized in basically two categories: latest (in reverse chronological order) and most popular (links to fan favorites). Navigation is at the top, with links to different catogories of his posts and to merch. <br/> 
			I think that Matthew Inman (creator of The Oatmeal) is lucky, because his website's objectives are pretty easy and his audience uniformly expects the same thing. Not sure if he has a lot of visual challenges, I think he has a clean simple layout to meet the relatively simple demands of his audience.

		<h2> MetalSucks.net</h2>
			<p>MetalSucks is trying to get a lot of different types of info in re: metal to its readership audience. Miscellaneous articles, which are listed in reverse chronological order. Album reviews, which are listed in the sidebar. Since they provide such a miscellaneous array of information in regards to metal (random posts, album reviews, tour info, etc), they provide a search bar, which is smart. <br/> 
			Visual challenges they face: trying to maximize information to their viewers without getting too cluttered visually. I see that they add borders and lines to try to visually organize the page, which helps.

		<h2>  ICanHasCheezburger</h2>
			<p>Cheezburger's website is dealing with the problem of meeting the demand of people's insatiable need to click quickly through animal gifs. They need to provide easy access to both the latest and greatest. They also need to provide easy sharing options, and linking of each post to social media, since people like to share the goodness. <br/> 
			Visual challenges again involve trying to keep the page organized and not let it get too cluttered. I think they could improve in this field, it still feels jumbled to me.
