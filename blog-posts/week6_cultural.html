		<h2> Stereotype Threat </h2>

		<h3>What is Stereotype Threat?</h3>
			<p> What is stereotype threat? According to social psychologist Dr. Claude Steele, it is the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype.  In other words, it is a type of subconscious self-handicapping. Everyone has experienced stereotype threat, because we are all members of some group (be it race, gender, ethnicity, religion, etc) about which negative stereotypes exist. And when one is in a situation where one of these stereotypes applies, we know that we may be judged by it. 
			</p>

			<p> To better understand this phenomenon, let's look at an example. Say you have a math classroom where both young boys and girls learn together. All the resources are the same - same teacher, same books, same classroom, same treatment. Why then, asked Dr. Steele, were the girls experiencing this math classroom so differently than the boys, to a degree of significance to affect their performance and achievement? The answer is this psychological phenomenon of stereotype threat. Steele found in his experiments that when girls are reminded, even in a subtle manner, of the stereotype that "men are better than women at math," the performance of girls in math tests measurably declined. 
			</p>

			<p> In essence, when there is a stereotype in the air and people are worried they might confirm the stereotype by performing poorly, these fears can inadvertently make the stereotype become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
			</p>

			<h3>My Experience</h3>
			<p> Upon self-reflection, I can definitely pinpoint instances in my own life where stereotype threat has reared its ugly head and affected my own performance and experience in something. 
			</p>

			<p> The most pertinent example of my experience with stereotype threat was during my attempt at a computer science major, back in my early college days around 2004 - 2005 (holy crap, I feel old now). When I first began, I loved it. All of the Intro to CS curriculum fascinated and stimulated me, and there were other women (not many, but a noticeable number) in my intro classes with me. I felt like there was plenty of help if/when I needed it, and the program felt supportive. However, as I progressed further into the major, there were fewer and fewer women left. I became one of only 2 or 3 women in any of the computer science core curriculum classes (data structures, computer engineering 16, etc).  The material, naturally, became much more challenging. As I became more frustrated with the material, and my lack of comprehension of it, I began to wonder if I was cut out for the CS major. There were many aspects of thinking that went into my self-examination: was I just not smart enough? Did my brain just not work that way? And I am not proud to admit, I also wondered to myself: "Is it because I am a girl? There's barely any girls left, maybe there's a reason for thatâ€¦"
			</p>

			<p> Dr. Steele explained that "frustration is the ingredient that makes the stereotype about your group relevant as an interpretation of your experience in the situation." This really rang a bell of recognition in my own head. The stereotype of women being inferior in math, science, and tech didn't rise in my consciousness UNTIL I started struggling and feeling frustration. Only then did I start to consider the stereotype as a reason for my struggles with the material. I started to worry that my being a girl was making my classmates not want to pair with me. I'm sure this affected my own behavior when I did pair with a classmate in my labs, and undoubtedly affected my confidence and subsequently their perception of my confidence and competency with the material. I distinctly remember feeling more and more uncomfortable in my TA sessions, in my pairing sessions, and just in my classes in general. There were a lot of reasons that went into my decision to give up on my CS major after a year and half. I do think that a big reason was letting my fear convince me that I would fail in the major (or perform really poorly), and that my failure would be confirming the stereotype that "girls were not meant to be in that field anyways." I did let the stereotype threat become self-fulfilling. And it is something that I have always regretted. Thank goodness I get a second chance (in a sense)!

			<h3>What to do to combat stereotype threat</h3>
			<h4>Principle of Identity Safety</h4>

			<p>Dr. Steele recounted his own personal experience with stereotype threat, in his grad school years. He said that at the time, being a black student meant encountering a lot of negative stereotypes and behavior, just on a daily basis. However, he had a mentor who acted differently, and acted in a way that treated Dr. Steele as if he was any other grad student there. His mentor expected and demanded a lot from him. He believed in him. That was enough to help Dr. Steele defend himself against stereotype threat in his own life, and succeed in his grad school program. He explains his mentor's actions as an example of the principle of Identity safety. Dr. Steele explains that, if there is a cue, if you can give someone a sense of being safe in an environment, you don't have to change EVERY cue (all the other cues that enforce stereotype threat). The individual is looking for a sense of safety, that their identity won't have to lead to the negative.
			</p>

			<p>I think this is a fantastic way to combat stereotype threat. If you can provide another person with that sense of safety, that in essence provides them a lifeline to fight against the stereotype threat.
			</p>

			<h4>Changing the way you give critical feedback</h4>
			<p>
			Dr. Steele recounted an experiment where they gave different black students feedback on voluntary essays they wrote. He explained that students did not show any inclination to improve their essays when they were given straight criticism, or the shit-sandwich style of criticism (complimenting them first, then doling out the criticism). What they DID respond to, however, was feedback that expressed confidence in their abilities, e.g. "I read your essay, and I think you have the ability to write a really great essay." By showing that you believe in them, and showing them ways they can improve, the student is more likely to go home, and improve their essay. 
			</p>

			<p>I think this type of feedback is something that would be very useful to implement at DBC (and indeed in life), because you won't necessarily be aware when a cohort-mate is experiencing stereotype threat and self-doubt. And as mentioned above, giving that person a sense of being safe and hope that their identity won't *have* to lead to the negative things they are fearing, that maybe be enough to help turn the tides for them.
