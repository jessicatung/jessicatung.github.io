		<h2> Dealing with Conflict </h2>
			<p> Before my office went through a series of re-orgs, it was run in such a way where individual attorneys could be appointed as "point of contacts" (POCs) for certain aspects of a case we were doing eDiscovery on (part of the pre-litigation process).  Both myself and another guy, whom I will call "Brad" for purposes of this blog, were assigned to be Source Code co-POCs on a certain case, indicating that we had joint responsibility of the source code aspects of the case (a variety of duties that mostly encompassed the protection of proprietary source code that needed to be segregated from and/or redacted out so that it did not land in the hands of the opposing party's counsel). Brad and I would meet up every day to perform these job duties together. However, as the case continued, he began to undermine me. We had agreed that since we were co-POCs on the case, we would approach the case manager together whenever we had updates, or questions. He began to renege on this agreement, and go behind my back to give reports to the case manager, or ask questions. He would then casually mention to me, much later, "oh, I talked to the case manager already, he said ______." </p>

			<p>
			I was very bothered by his behavior, on multiple levels. For one thing, he had gone back on his word to me by continually meeting with the case manager behind my back, even though we had agreed to do so together, since we were co-POCs. For another thing, it seemed like he was sabotaging me - he would purposely misstate instructions from the case manager, so that I would make mistakes or be confused as to what was expected, requiring me to approach the case manager myself (causing me to look stupid, since the case manager already explained instructions to Brad and assumed the instructions would be passed correctly onto me). In short, Brad was making me look bad. To make things worse, it seemed like Brad was being rewarded for this behavior - he was given updates on the case during his clandestine meetings with the case manager, and looking like the one who was "on the ball" while I was left in the dark. I was very upset during this time, because it was important to me to do my job well, and I felt like Brad's behavior was impacting my ability to do so. I was afraid that the situation was reflecting poorly upon me, even though I wasn't the one engaging in bad behavior. </p>

			<p>
			I shared my feelings with my friends in the office, who encouraged me to report Brad's behavior, or to confront him. I didn't want to be the "snitch" or rat him out for his behavior. I did ask Brad, politely, to please stick to our agreement to approach the case managers together, as a team. He would give a bunch of bullshit excuses as to why he approached the case manager on his own ("oh, it was just such a small question, I didn't think it was worth involving you"), and promise to stick to the agreement in the future, but then instantly go back on his word and continue about in the same manner. It seemed like he was intent on climbing the ladder, and wasn't afraid to crush me beneath him in his quest to do so. 
			</p>

			<p>
			I contemplated what I could do to improve my situation. I decided to not be a narc and rat him out to the bosses, but to take "the high road" and just continue to do my work, be the best POC I could be, and hope that my hard work would show despite Brad's attempts to undermine me at every turn. It was an extremely difficult thing to do, as Brad was seriously pissing me off and upsetting me. I hoped that karma would bite him in the ass, I'm not gonna lie! 
			</p>

			<p>
			Looking back, I wish I would have confronted Brad again, and been more firm. I think that I was right to not rat him out to the bosses, because even if it might have stopped his behavior, I wouldn't have felt like that was "right" in my gut. However, I think that my lack of confrontation was a practice of avoidance. I didn't want to deal with the possible fall-out from confronting Brad out on his behavior again. I think I was in denial that it was as big of a problem as it was, and I ignored my feelings that indicated it WAS a big deal, emotionally. By allowing him to continue in his behavior, I wasn't respecting myself enough. I should have stood up for myself, and tried to put the kabosh on his shady behavior. 
			</p>

			<p>
			It took me a long time to get over this incident, and honestly, I never looked at Brad the same again afterwards. What I learned from this incident was to be less afraid of confrontation, and to stick up for myself. I think that I could have firmly, but still respectfully, asked Brad to cut that shit out. It may or may not have changed anything in the end. But I think if I had tried to confront him again, I would have felt better about myself, and would have less regret in hindsight.
