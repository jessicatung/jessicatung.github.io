		<h1> Jessica's Week 1 Cultural Blog</h1>
		<p> Please pardon the lack of pizazz, was running out of time!</p>

		<h2> Kitchen vs. Table </h2>
			<p> I think Shereef's fireside chat reaffirmed my decision that DBC is the right choice for me, as far as the next step in my life. His depiction of the "creator/kitchen mindset" really appealed to me. I think that taking ownership and responsibility for your own success in the program, being an active member of the team, being "all in this together" is a totally refreshing take on things, and is absolutely a big part of the reason why DBC so innovative and succesful. Being ok with "making a mess" while you learn, really dig in, and get involved in your own education - I am looking forward to this!  <br/>

		<h2> Engaging in DBC culture</h2>
			<p> Shereef's discussion of "Imposter Syndrome" really hit me, because I definitely am suffering from this syndrome. I am nervous that I am already behind coming into DBC, worrying that I won't be "good enough" or "smart enough" or "fast enough." Even working on this first week's assignments really kicked my ass. I am still working full time, with a commute between Oakland and Mountain View that averages a total of 2.5 - 4 hours a day. Additionally, I made the mistake of agreeing to a violin gig, which required me to attend rehearsals, a recording sessions, and a performance last night. I basically didn't start on this week's assignments until today, which was (needless to say) a terrible idea. :) <br/> 
			Despite this rocky start, I definitely have a fire lit under my ass to do better. I'm excited to learn, to grow, to be challenged on a daily basis, and to work with amazing people. I have only started to meet the other members of my cohort, but am already impressed by the smart, fun, and passionate people I have come across!
			</p>

		<h2>  Expectations and Excitement</h2>
			<p>I am expecting my DBC experience to be many things: exciting, exhilerating, nerve-wracking, rewarding, challenging, fun, frustrating... I am absolutely excited to get started. Let's do this.<br/>
