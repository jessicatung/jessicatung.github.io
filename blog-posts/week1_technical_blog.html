		<h1> Jessica's Week 1 Technical Blog</h1>
		<p> Please pardon the lack of pizazz, was running out of time!</p>

		<h2> The Oatmeal </h2>
		<div class = "image"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/thumbnails/pelvic_thrusting_cats.png"/></div>
			<p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank">The Oatmeal</a> is one of my favorite sites, because it's so darn fun. Matthew Inman is a total weirdo/goof who is a great writer and illustrator, and sheds all kinds of silly light on random topics such as the mantis shrimp, proper grammar, Nicola Tesla, the Tesla Model S, and the list goes on. It's a great site for procrastination, AND you might learn something too! <br/> 
			Visually, it is: <br/>
				<ul class = purple>
					<li>Fun</li>
					<li>Silly</li>
					<li>Infographic</li>
					<li>Whimsical</li>
					<li>Awesome</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h2> MetalSucks.net </h2>
		<div class = "image"><img src="http://static.tumblr.com/u7hhjk2/Xkklxe7j1/carve_slayer.jpg"/></div>
			<p><a href="http://www.metalsucks.net/" target="_blank">MetalSucks</a> is a misleading nomer. Because, in fact, METAL IS AWESOME. I visit this site often to keep tabs on the latest metal album releases and streams of new tracks, rumors in re: metal happenings, upcoming tours, etc. When is Mastodon's new album coming out? Metalsucks can tell you. What ridiculous shenanigans is Dave Mustaine up to? Metalsucks can tell you that too! Full of snark, attitude, humor, and yes, HEAVY METAL. \m/  <br/> 
			I would describe the content as: <br/>
				<ul class = purple>
					<li>Br00tal</li>
					<li>Kvlt</li>
					<li>Heavy (metal)</li>
					<li>Full of shredding riffs</li>
					<li>Awesome</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h2> I Can Has Cheezburger? </h2>
		<div class = "image"><img src="http://www.thedigeratilife.com/images/tiny-cheezburger3.jpg"/></div>
			<p><a href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/" target="_blank">I Can Has Cheezburger?</a> is full of cute animals, 'nuff said. In order to survive, I must view fulfill a daily viewing quota of cute animal gifs. This website ensures that I do not die. I feel like the layout of the website leaves something to be desired, it's a tad cluttered and not at all elegant. Then again, a site that spells cheeseburger as "cheezburger".... what do you expect? <br/> 
			The site is: <br/>
				<ul class = purple>
					<li>Adorbs</li>
					<li>Fuzzy-feeling-inducing</li>
					<li>Happy</li>
					<li>Full of cutes</li>
					<li>Awesome</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
