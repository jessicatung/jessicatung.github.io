		<h2> We Need more Women in Tech! </h2>
			<p> The fact that there are far more men working in the tech field than women is not news to anyone. This disparity has been well documented, and has been receiving a decent amount of media coverage as of late as well. This blog post cannot hope to cover all the angles of this issue. Instead, I am going to focus on only one aspect of this problem - the fact that the demand for tech jobs is rapidly growing, at a pace that the current supply chain of mostly-male engineers and developers cannot realistically fulfill. We need more women!
			</p>

		<h3>Why is the lack of women in tech a problem?</h3>
			<p> According to many estimates, by the year 2020, there will be 1 million more tech jobs vacant than there are qualified students ready to fill them, worldwide. One of the big factors accounting for this shortfall is the lack of women entering computer science and other tech related programs, particularly in the US. Here, only ~ 18% of students in computer science programs are women. This statistic is particularly jarring when compared to the corresponding statistics in many countries far less gender progressive than ours. For example, in Myanmar, 60% of students in computer science programs are women. Myanmar, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are countries which are leaders in educating women in computer science. The US needs to step up!
			</p>

		<h3>Potential solutions!</h3>
			<p>
			Kara Swisher, founder and co-executive editor at Recode.net points out that in order to draw girls into these fields, we need to provide more examples of women in the field for girls to look up to. Furthermore, these women role models will, in turn, hire other women into the field.  In fact, when examining tech companies across the board, Swisher found that only ~12.3% of the engineers are women, but when a tech company has a female CEO, the percentage jumps to almost a 50-50 split between female and male engineers! Thus, hiring more women into leadership roles could potentially be a big step in the right direction towards solving this dilemma.
			</p>
			<p>Larry Page, chief exec of Google, agrees that recruiting women is a top priority: "If we do that, there's no question we'll more than double the rate of technology output in the world." However, even at Google, less than 1/5th of the engineering population consists of women.</p>
			<p>There is also a strong movement to support women in tech, wherein women-only hacker spaces and programs have been growing and expanding, in the hopes of increasing the number of women in the profession. While these programs are not free from controversy (some find that these women-only programs "cultivate the notion that women are these weak beings who find their male colleagues too intimidating"), their spirit of fostering support for women in tech is another step forward towards a solution.</p>
			<p>Personally, I also think that accelerated bootcamp programs such as Dev Bootcamp can be an important part of the solution. I am coming to Dev Bootcamp as someone looking for a second chance at a career in tech, since going back to college to get a CS degree is neither practical nor financially viable. I am an adult woman who is considering leaving her current career path as an attorney, for the hopefully greener and more satisfying career pastures as a developer. Dev Bootcamp is providing me with a fighting chance to make this dream come true. Additionally, Dev Bootcamp offers a diversity scholarship for women, as an added incentive. </p>
			<p>While it is true that we need to start drawing girls and young women into the field early, by encouraging them to pursue education and careers in math, science, and technology, that does not address the immediate need for more women in tech, here and now. Dev Bootcamp, and other programs like it, helps to address this immediate need, and provides people like my cohort-mates and myself a chance to be an active part of the solution. </p>
