		<h2>Gregorc Thinking Style - Concrete Sequential </h2>
			<p> When I performed the self analysis, Concrete Sequential won by a small margin over Abstract Sequential. Honestly, I can see a lot of myself in the listed traits for both types! But since CS won over AS, I will focus on CS for purposes of this blog. (As a side note, one of the challenges for an AS thinker is having "too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly" - something that has been VERY frustrating for me thus far in Phase 0).
			</p>

			<p>CS thinkers like order, logical sequence, following directions, predictability and getting facts. They like a structured environment, and learn best when they can apply concepts they've learned in pragmatic ways. I definitely feel like my personal thinking style aligns with these preferences. I think this week's challenge 3 and 4 really appealed to me, because they were designed in a way that complimented the sequential step-by-step linear progression of thinking that I naturally engage in.</p>

			<p>On the flipside, CS thinkers don't like discussions that seem to have no specific point, working in an unorganized environment, following incomplete or unclear directions, and working with unpredictable people. Again, I agree that these all fall very much in the category of "dislike" for me, personally. I think that is one of the reasons I had a hard time with challenge 5 this week - it was extremely open ended, and I felt like I had incomplete directions and a knowledge gap between what was expected between challenge 4 (which I found quite doable) and challenge 5 (which I found to be extremely challenging). In my own defense, I DID enjoy designing the mission and coming up with the "story" of my code combat. I enjoy creative endeavors like that! I had more of a problem with, "How do I create the code to execute my idea? I feel like I don't have enough knowledge information to be able to do it!"</p>

			<p>Thus far in Phase 0, the biggest struggle for me has been time management. Trying to complete the week's challenges by the deadline, while still working a fulltime job that involves a really long-ass commute. I don't think this is related to the way I think, but rather stems from practical reality. I just recently (at the suggestion of one of my accountability group members) started using a pomodoro timer app. This helps keep me on track, and helps me to use my limited time more effectively and efficiently! Also, I think that the pomodoro method works well for my CS thinking - it provides a structured environment for me. I have 25 minute increments to get focused work done, and built-in breaks. The pomodoros and breaks fall at predictable times, help me organize my strategy for tackling the challenges, and provide some order in the somewhat hectic world that is Phase 0! All things that appeal to my CS brain.</p>

			<p>In the spirit of the growth mindset, it's been great to get outside of my comfort zone in terms of the experiences that Phase 0 has brought. For example, one of the listed activities that is "hard" for CS thinkers to engage in is "working in groups." While I don't agree that is the case with me, per se, I definitely have some loner tendencies and can comfortably and easily retreat into myself and my own thinking. The built-in GPS and peer pairing sessions have been great experiences for me. My pairing partners have really been fantastic at providing alternative ways at approaching the problems, suggesting alternative solutions that I could not come up with on my own, and just really expanding my horizons in a very effective and fast way. I absolutely feel like the few peer pairing sessions I have participated in have absolutely expanded the ways I learn and think, and helped me to be more rounded in my approache to problems. Since DBC is such a collaborative environment, this growth will no doubt continue as we move forward! </p>
