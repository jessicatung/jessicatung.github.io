		<h2> Asking Good Questions </h2>
		<p class="date"> July 10, 2014</p>

			<p> As a budding developer, your colleagues in the field are an invaluable source of information. They are the ones that can provide guidance, help you get un-stuck, and hopefully, answer your questions when you inevitably have them. However, in order to get the help that you need, you have to be able to ask these questions effectively. Poorly phrased questions will be ignored, answered ineffectually or incompletely, or possibly (likely) even ridiculed. But fear not, for there is guidance out there to help you ask "good questions," thus increasing the likelihood of receiving a "good" answer in response! </p>

			<h3>Elements of a well-phrased question</h3>

			<p>
			In Jon Skeet's Coding Blog, he states that The Golden Rule when writing a question is to imagine you yourself are trying to answer the question you wrote. Re-read your question after you write it. Does the question make sense? Is it clear what is being asked without any other context besides what's there on the screen? Are you making it clear WHAT is being asked?  </p>

			<p>
			Next, consider the question's title. Try to aim for short and descriptive, something which captures the gist of the question. Specificity is always good too, no one wants to answer a question that is titled "Why the F doesn't this work?!" or "send me teh codez plz." What is the topic of your question? That should be clear in the title. One helpful hint to writing a good title, write it last! It'll probably be easier to describe the problem then.
			</p>

			<p>
			Also consider the context provided in your question. Are you providing the reader with enough information to be ABLE to answer your question? The person answering your question will want to know what language and platform you are using. They may also want to know other relevant aspects (operating system, constraints, etc.). Is there stuff you already tried that didn't work? You should probably describe that, so people don't suggest them again. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Furthermore, consider the way you are stating your problem. Be detailed about what you're trying to get out of the question you're asking. What did you expect the code to do? What are you trying to accomplish? What happened in previous attempts? 
			</p>

			<h3> Other things to consider</h3>
			<p>
			Jon Skeet also recommends providing sample code and data, both when asking questions AND providing answers. Try to keep the code short and sweet, no one wants to wade through tons of code to find the relevant problem.
