		<h2> Values and Stereotype Threat </h2>
		<h3>Exploring Values</h3>
			<p> When I looked at that list, I think a few of the values that jumped out at me were: Affection, Autonomy, Creativity, Friendships, Growth, Independence, Inspiration, Integrity, Music, Peace, Persistence, Self-reliance, and Self-Respect. In all honesty, it's hard to correspond these values to the times in my life when I've been the most happy. Because when I've been happy, I have tried to just *be* in the moment, and not really analyze the context of my happiness, if that makes sense. So even looking back, it's challenging to pinpoint the values that correspond to those times. 
			</p>
		<h3>Growth </h3>
			<p>One value that is particularly important to me is Growth. I think this value is what led me to DBC. I have been working the same job, as a document review attorney working on contract, for the past 2 years. After about 6 months, I began noticing sensations of stagnation, dissatisfaction, unhappiness, and boredom. I realized that at the root of these feelings was the lack of growth at that job- the lack of learning opportunities, and the lack of feeling like I was able to learn something new every day and expand my horizons. After a certain point in that position, there was nothing *new* to be gleaned. It was just same damn thing, day in and day out.</p>
			<p>I've talked about the philosophical idea of Eudaimonia with my cohort, in our first cultural assignment where we emailed each other about our fears. Basically, Eudaimonia defines happiness as the pursuit of becoming a better person.  To contrast with Hedonia/Hedonism (pleasure as the path to happiness), Eudaimonists do this by challenging themselves intellectually and engaging in activities that make them richer people, internally. Furthermore, Eudaimonists believe that happiness is a journey, rather than the destination (which is the hedonic view). I had been struggling with the lack of growth, challenge, and stimulation at my previous job. I came to realize that I wouldn't be happy there, because there was no opportunity for growth, and that was something that I needed in order to feel fulfilled. I came across the concept of Eudaimonia and felt like it described my feelings exactly. I started thinking about the changes I would need to make in my career so that I would feel challenged and be able to grow in this manner, and that led me to DBC. Since making the decision to do DBC, I have felt much happier. And throughout this Phase 0 process, I have already felt like I've been challenged and mentally stimulated to a great degree, and feeling like I'm growing as a developer is a truly awesome feeling.</p>

		<h3>Advice</h3>

		<p>Recently, my friend was discussing with me his thoughts on whether he should attend the wedding of our friend Jon. My friend has a small baby at home, and said that "as weird as it sounds, I'd rather be at home and play with my son and listen to him fart in his crib than have to put on fancy clothes and go to the wedding." I told him that I totally understood, but that he should also consider that his presence at the wedding would mean a lot to our friend Jon. He told me later that he hadn't thought about it that way, and that it helped him to put that into perspective. He explained that I helped him realize that his attendance at the wedding was about Jon, and not about himself, and he decided that he absolutely did want to be there for Jon. I guess I wasn't really ASKED for advice in this situation, as much as I provided advice, unsolicited :)</p>
		<p>I don't really know how to tie in this advice with the theme of this blog post, except for the fact that it's important to seek perspective from others. I think it's really easy to get bogged down in one's own life and problems, and that it's good to turn to others for an alternative view point! I have already found my cohort mates to be an invaluable source of inspiration, advice, and yes, perspective. </p>

		<h3>Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p>When I think about my values, I feel a range of things. My values are something that are important to me, and I try to hold true to them. Sometimes that can feel like a burden, or a high standard to hold myself against, and it's easy to berate myself when I feel like I fall short. But I also try to think of striving to hold true to my values as a journey, and something that we constantly work towards improving and doing better by. And when I think of my values that way, it feels less burdensome</p>
			<p>I hope that when I feel stereotype threat bubble up inside me, that I will look to my values to help me mediate those negative feelings. I hope that I remember that my persistence is what got me to where I am in my life today, and that the stereotype threat fear that I am struggling with coding due to some stereotypical reason, is put into perspective through that. I hope in those situations, that I remember to hold true to my values of persistence, and desire for growth, and creativity, and that these negative feelings that come with stereotype threat can be seen as just a part of the experience, and something to overcome. </p>
